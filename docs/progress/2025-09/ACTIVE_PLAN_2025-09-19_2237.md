## Success Criteria
- [x] Zero port conflicts in multi-instance development
- [x] CORE documentation standard compliance
- [x] Real-time coordination without race conditions
- [x] Complete CLI interface for all operations
- [x] Universal documentation standard compliance

## Decision Points
- **Architecture Choice**: Pure daemon approach ✅ Selected and implemented
- **Configuration Source**: CORE documentation integration ✅ Completed
- **API Design**: REST HTTP interface ✅ Implemented and tested

## Resources Required
- No additional external dependencies
- No infrastructure requirements beyond local development
- Documentation migration only requires file reorganization

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: System is fully functional and tested
- **Documentation Migration**: Low impact, organizational improvement only
- **Future Enhancements**: Optional, system works without them
