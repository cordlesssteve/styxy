# Styxy - Active Development Plan
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Created:** 2025-09-17
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-17
**Priority:** Maintenance & Enhancement

## Current Focus: Advanced Feature Development

### Phase 1: Documentation Structure Migration ✅
**Status:** Complete
**Goal:** Migrate Styxy to Universal Project Documentation Standard

#### Completed Tasks:
- [x] Create CURRENT_STATUS.md
- [x] Create ACTIVE_PLAN.md
- [x] Set up required docs directory structure
- [x] Migrate existing DESIGN.md to reference structure
- [x] Add proper status headers to all documents
- [x] Create 9-category reference documentation system
- [x] Update README.md with documentation system

### Phase 2: Production Readiness Validation ✅
**Status:** Complete
**Goal:** Ensure system is production-ready

#### Completed:
- ✅ Full CLI command suite implementation
- ✅ CORE documentation integration
- ✅ Real-time daemon coordination
- ✅ Multi-instance template support
- ✅ Comprehensive testing of all features

### Phase 3: Enhanced Port Detection & Monitoring ✅
**Status:** Complete
**Goal:** Advanced features for enhanced reliability and real-world port detection

#### Completed Improvements:
1. **OS-Level Port Validation** ✅
   - ✅ Integrated `lsof`, `netstat`, and `ss` for actual port usage checking
   - ✅ Detects ports used by processes outside Styxy coordination
   - ✅ Cross-platform compatibility with fallback detection methods
   - ✅ Caching system for performance optimization

2. **Enhanced CLI Interface** ✅
   - ✅ `styxy check` shows detailed system process information
   - ✅ `styxy scan` command for range-based port discovery
   - ✅ Process identification with PID, name, and protocol details
   - ✅ Visual distinction between Styxy and system allocations

3. **Real-Time Detection** ✅
   - ✅ Async port availability checking
   - ✅ Multi-method detection with graceful fallbacks
   - ✅ Detailed port usage reporting via API endpoints

### Phase 4: Future Enhancements (Optional)
**Status:** Planned
**Goal:** Additional advanced features

#### Potential Improvements:
1. **Advanced Process Monitoring**
   - Enhanced liveness checking beyond PID validation
   - Process start time verification for stale allocation detection

2. **Configuration Templates**
   - Project-specific port configuration templates
   - Environment-based service type overrides

3. **Integration Enhancements**
   - Docker container port coordination
   - CI/CD pipeline port management

## Success Criteria
- [x] Zero port conflicts in multi-instance development
- [x] CORE documentation standard compliance
- [x] Real-time coordination without race conditions
- [x] Complete CLI interface for all operations
- [x] Universal documentation standard compliance

## Decision Points
- **Architecture Choice**: Pure daemon approach ✅ Selected and implemented
- **Configuration Source**: CORE documentation integration ✅ Completed
- **API Design**: REST HTTP interface ✅ Implemented and tested

## Resources Required
- No additional external dependencies
- No infrastructure requirements beyond local development
- Documentation migration only requires file reorganization

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: System is fully functional and tested
- **Documentation Migration**: Low impact, organizational improvement only
- **Future Enhancements**: Optional, system works without them
