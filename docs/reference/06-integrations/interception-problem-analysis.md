# AI Agent Port Allocation Problem Space Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes a coordination problem that occurs when AI agents attempt to use automation tools in environments with existing port management infrastructure. The analysis focuses on defining the problem space, constraints, and requirements without prescribing solutions.

## Problem Space Definition

### Core Problem Statement
AI agents operating in development environments require access to various automation tools (browser automation, testing frameworks, development servers) that need network ports. These agents currently lack integration with existing port coordination systems, leading to resource allocation conflicts and operational inefficiencies.

### Problem Manifestation
When an AI agent determines it needs to use an automation tool:

1. **Tool Recognition**: Agent identifies need for specific tool (e.g., Playwright, Selenium, Cypress)
2. **Port Requirement**: Tool requires network port for operation
3. **Allocation Attempt**: Agent or tool attempts to bind to a port
4. **Potential Conflict**: Port may already be allocated by coordination system
5. **Retry Behavior**: Failed attempts result in retry loops or alternative port attempts
6. **Resource Waste**: Time and computational resources spent on failed allocations

### Observable Symptoms
- Failed service starts due to port conflicts
- Multiple retry attempts by agents or tools
- Unpredictable port assignments across sessions
- Coordination system bypassed entirely
- Resource contention between multiple agent instances

## Problem Boundaries and Constraints

### Scope Inclusions
- **Agent Types**: AI agents capable of executing shell commands or automation tools
- **Tool Categories**: Browser automation, testing frameworks, development servers, proxy services
- **Environment**: Development and testing environments with existing port coordination
- **Scale**: Single machine with multiple agent instances or multiple concurrent sessions

### Scope Exclusions
- **Production Environments**: Focus is on development/testing scenarios
- **Non-Port Resources**: CPU, memory, or other resource allocation outside of network ports
- **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Direct communication protocols between AI agents
- **Tool Internal Logic**: Modification of automation tool source code

### Technical Constraints

#### Existing Infrastructure Constraints

**Styxy Port Coordination System Architecture**

Styxy is a sophisticated port coordination daemon designed for multi-instance development environments. The system provides centralized port allocation through a background daemon process that maintains state and coordinates resource allocation across multiple clients.

**Core Components:**
- **Background Daemon Process**: Single long-running process (`styxy-daemon`) that serves as the authoritative source for port coordination
- **HTTP REST API**: Express.js server on configurable port (default 9876) providing programmatic access to coordination functions
- **In-Memory State Management**: Real-time allocation tracking using JavaScript Maps for performance
- **Filesystem Persistence**: State backup to `~/.styxy/daemon.state` for recovery after daemon restart
- **Cross-Platform Port Scanner**: Multi-method OS-level port detection using `ss`, `lsof`, and `netstat`

**Service Type Intelligence System:**
Styxy implements a service-type-aware allocation system with 13 predefined categories sourced from CORE Documentation Standard:

| Service Type | Port Range | Preferred Ports | Purpose |
|--------------|------------|----------------|---------|
| dev | 3000-3099 | 3000,3001,3002,3003 | Frontend development (React, Next.js, Vite) |
| api | 8000-8099 | 8000,8001,8002,8003 | Backend API servers (Express, FastAPI) |
| database | 8080-8099 | 8080,8081,8082,8083 | Database/Firestore emulators |
| auth | 9099-9199 | 9099,9100,9101,9102 | Authentication services |
| functions | 5000-5099 | 5001,5002,5003,5004 | Firebase Functions/serverless |
| ui | 4000-4099 | 4000,4001,4002,4003 | Admin interfaces |
| hub | 4400-4499 | 4400,4401,4402,4403 | Multi-service coordination |
| storybook | 6006-6029 | 6006,6007,6008,6009 | Component development |
| test | 9200-9299 | 9200,9201,9202,9203 | Browser debugging/testing tools |
| proxy | 8100-8199 | 8100,8101,8102,8103 | Development proxies |
| docs | 4100-4199 | 4100,4101,4102,4103 | Documentation servers |
| monitoring | 3100-3199 | 3100,3101,3102,3103 | Metrics dashboards |
| build | 8200-8299 | 8200,8201,8202,8203 | Build system services |

**Allocation Logic and Process Tracking:**
- **Preferred Port Priority**: Attempts service-specific preferred ports first, falls back to range scanning
- **Atomic Operations**: All allocations happen atomically to prevent race conditions
- **Process Monitoring**: Tracks allocated processes by PID and start time for reliable cleanup
- **Real-time Cleanup**: Automatic port release when monitored processes terminate
- **Lock-based System**: Each allocation receives a UUID lock identifier for explicit release

**HTTP API Capabilities:**
- `POST /allocate`: Request port allocation with service type, optional preferred port, instance metadata
- `DELETE /allocate/{lockId}`: Release specific allocation by lock ID
- `GET /check/{port}`: Detailed port availability with allocation and system usage info
- `GET /scan?start=X&end=Y`: Range scanning for port usage analysis
- `GET /allocations`: List all current allocations with metadata
- `POST /cleanup`: Force cleanup of stale allocations
- `POST /instance/register`: Register AI agent instances for tracking
- `PUT /instance/{id}/heartbeat`: Maintain instance liveness

**Instance Management and Multi-Agent Support:**
- **Instance Registration**: AI agents can register with daemon for coordination tracking
- **Heartbeat System**: Periodic liveness updates for instance health monitoring
- **Project-Aware Allocation**: Port allocations can be associated with specific project paths
- **Metadata Support**: Arbitrary metadata attachment to allocations for debugging/monitoring

**OS-Level Port Detection:**
The PortScanner utility provides robust cross-platform port availability checking:
- **Multiple Detection Methods**: Uses `ss` (modern Linux), `lsof` (Unix-like), `netstat` (fallback)
- **Caching System**: 5-second cache for performance optimization
- **Detailed Port Information**: Process identification, protocol detection, address binding analysis
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficient multi-port status checking
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful degradation when detection tools unavailable

**State Management and Recovery:**
- **In-Memory Performance**: Primary state in RAM for fast allocation operations
- **Persistent Backup**: Regular state snapshots to filesystem for daemon restart recovery
- **Process Validation**: Startup validation of existing allocations against running processes
- **Cleanup Mechanisms**: Both automatic (process monitoring) and manual (API-triggered) cleanup

**Configuration and Compliance:**
- **CORE Integration**: Automatic loading of port configurations from standardized documentation
- **User Override Support**: Optional user configuration in `~/.styxy/config.json`
- **Validation System**: Range enforcement, sequential allocation, conflict detection
- **Multi-Instance Templates**: Predefined offset patterns for development workflows

This infrastructure provides a sophisticated foundation for coordinated port allocation, but currently operates independently of AI agent tool invocation processes.

#### Agent Constraints
- **Command Execution**: Agents execute commands through shell or programmatic interfaces
- **Tool Detection**: Agents must recognize when automation tools are needed
- **Port Awareness**: Current agents lack awareness of port coordination systems
- **Session Isolation**: Each agent instance operates independently

#### Tool Constraints
- **Port Configuration**: Tools accept port configuration through various mechanisms
- **Default Behavior**: Tools have built-in default port preferences
- **Environment Variables**: Many tools respect environment variables for configuration
- **Command Line Arguments**: Tools typically accept port specification via CLI arguments

### Interaction Patterns

#### Current Agent Behavior Pattern
```
Agent Decision → Tool Invocation → Port Binding Attempt → [Success|Failure|Retry]
```

#### Current Styxy Coordination Pattern
```
Service Request → Port Allocation → Process Monitoring → Cleanup on Exit
```

#### Disconnected Systems Pattern
```
Agent Path:    Agent → Tool → Port Attempt → Conflict
Styxy Path:    Client → Styxy → Allocated Port → Success
Result:        Two separate allocation mechanisms
```
