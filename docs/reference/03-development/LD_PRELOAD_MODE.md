# LD_PRELOAD Automatic Port Reassignment

**Status:** Production Ready
**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11

## Overview

Styxy's LD_PRELOAD mode provides **automatic port reassignment** for any application that tries to bind to an occupied port. When enabled, if a program attempts to use a port that's already in use, Styxy automatically reassigns it to an available alternative port.

### Key Benefits

- **Universal**: Works with ANY language (Python, Node.js, Go, Rust, C, etc.)
- **Transparent**: Applications don't need modification
- **Automatic**: Zero manual intervention required
- **Visible**: Claude sees reassignment notifications in command output
- **Fail-safe**: Gracefully handles daemon unavailability

### How It Works

When a Claude Code session starts, the SessionStart hook automatically sets the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable to load Styxy's shared library. This library intercepts all `bind()` system calls:

1. Application tries to bind to a port (e.g., port 8000)
2. If port is available â†’ bind succeeds normally
3. If port is occupied â†’ Styxy queries daemon for suggestions
4. Library automatically binds to suggested port (e.g., 3001)
5. Application runs successfully on the reassigned port
6. Claude sees notification: "âœ“ STYXY: Port 8000 was in use, auto-assigned port 3001"

## Getting Started

### Verify LD_PRELOAD Mode is Active

When you start a new Claude Code session, you should see:

```
ðŸ”§ Styxy LD_PRELOAD mode active - automatic port reassignment enabled
âœ… Styxy port coordination active (Instance: claude-code-...)
```

If you see these messages, automatic port reassignment is working.

### Check Current Status

```bash
# Check if LD_PRELOAD is set
echo $LD_PRELOAD
# Output: /home/username/lib/styxy-intercept.so

# Verify library exists
ls -lh ~/lib/styxy-intercept.so
# Output: -rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 17K Oct 11 22:17 /home/username/lib/styxy-intercept.so

# Check daemon is running
node bin/styxy instances
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Python HTTP Server

```bash
# Start Python server on port 8000 (occupied by chroma)
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**Output:**
```
âœ“ STYXY: Port 8000 was in use, auto-assigned port 3001
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 3001 (http://0.0.0.0:3001/) ...
```

The server automatically runs on port 3001 instead!

### Example 2: Node.js Development Server

```bash
# npm start tries to use port 3000 (already in use)
npm start
```

**Output:**
```
âœ“ STYXY: Port 3000 was in use, auto-assigned port 3002
Server listening on port 3002
```

### Example 3: Custom Application

```bash
# Your application tries port 6006
./my-app --port 6006
```

**Output:**
```
âœ“ STYXY: Port 6006 was in use, auto-assigned port 6007
Application started on port 6007
```

### Example 4: Multiple Conflicts

If the first suggestion is also busy, Styxy tries the next available port automatically:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 3001
```

**Output:**
```
âœ“ STYXY: Port 3001 was in use, auto-assigned port 3002
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 3002 ...
```

## How Applications See the Reassigned Port

Applications use the **reassigned port** automatically. Here's what happens:

```c
// Your application code
int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
struct sockaddr_in addr;
addr.sin_port = htons(8000);  // You request port 8000

// LD_PRELOAD intercepts bind()
bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&addr, sizeof(addr));

// Library automatically changes addr.sin_port to 3001 if 8000 is busy
// Your application proceeds with port 3001, completely unaware

getsockname(sockfd, ...);  // Returns port 3001
// Your application logs: "Server started on port 3001"
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can customize LD_PRELOAD behavior with these environment variables:

#### `STYXY_DAEMON_PORT`
Override the daemon port (default: 9876)

```bash
export STYXY_DAEMON_PORT=9877
```

#### `STYXY_DAEMON_HOST`
Override the daemon host (default: 127.0.0.1)

```bash
export STYXY_DAEMON_HOST=192.168.1.100
```

#### `STYXY_DISABLE_REASSIGN`
Temporarily disable automatic reassignment

```bash
export STYXY_DISABLE_REASSIGN=1
python3 -m http.server 8000  # Will fail if port busy instead of reassigning
```

#### `LD_PRELOAD`
Manually control LD_PRELOAD activation

```bash
# Disable for a single command
LD_PRELOAD="" python3 -m http.server 8000

# Re-enable
export LD_PRELOAD="${HOME}/lib/styxy-intercept.so"
```

### Disabling LD_PRELOAD Mode

To disable automatic port reassignment for your session:

```bash
unset LD_PRELOAD
```

To permanently disable, comment out the export line in `~/.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`:

```bash
# echo "export LD_PRELOAD=\"${LDPRELOAD_LIB}\""
```

## Audit Logging

All port reassignments are logged to `/tmp/styxy-reassignments.log`:

```bash
cat /tmp/styxy-reassignments.log
```

**Example output:**
```
[2025-10-11 19:25:22] PID 110548: Port 8000 -> 3001 (service: dev)
[2025-10-11 19:29:44] PID 121458: Port 8000 -> 3001 (service: dev)
[2025-10-11 19:42:09] PID 147965: Port 8000 -> 3001 (service: dev)
```

Each entry shows:
- Timestamp
- Process ID
- Original port â†’ Reassigned port
- Service type (used for selecting port range)

## Troubleshooting

### "Port conflict but no reassignment happened"

**Possible causes:**

1. **LD_PRELOAD not set**
   ```bash
   echo $LD_PRELOAD
   # If empty, run: export LD_PRELOAD="${HOME}/lib/styxy-intercept.so"
   ```

2. **Library doesn't exist**
   ```bash
   ls ~/lib/styxy-intercept.so
   # If missing, library needs to be compiled
   ```

3. **Daemon not running**
   ```bash
   node bin/styxy instances
   # If fails, daemon needs to be started
   ```

4. **Port < 1024 (privileged ports)**
   LD_PRELOAD only intercepts user ports (>= 1024). System ports require root privileges.

### "Library not loading"

Check if the library is valid:

```bash
file ~/lib/styxy-intercept.so
# Should show: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object

# Check for errors
LD_PRELOAD=~/lib/styxy-intercept.so /bin/true
```

### "Reassignment happening but application doesn't work"

Some applications cache the port number before binding. If the application checks what port it's bound to after `bind()`, it should work correctly. Example:

```python
# This works - Python checks the actual bound port
with socketserver.TCPServer(("", 8000), Handler) as httpd:
    print(f"Serving on port {httpd.server_address[1]}")  # Shows actual port
```

### "No notification message visible"

Notifications go to stdout. Some applications may buffer or redirect output. Check the audit log:

```bash
tail -f /tmp/styxy-reassignments.log
```

### "Daemon authentication error"

The library needs the auth token:

```bash
ls ~/.styxy/auth.token
# Should exist and be readable

# Verify token works
TOKEN=$(cat ~/.styxy/auth.token)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:9876/status
# Should return daemon status
```

## Advanced Topics

### How bind() Interception Works

The LD_PRELOAD library uses dynamic linking to intercept system calls:

```c
// 1. Get original bind() function
original_bind = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "bind");

// 2. Try original bind() first
result = original_bind(sockfd, addr, addrlen);

// 3. If EADDRINUSE (port busy), query daemon for suggestions
if (result == -1 && errno == EADDRINUSE) {
    suggestions = get_port_suggestions("dev");

    // 4. Try each suggested port
    for (each suggestion) {
        addr->sin_port = htons(suggestion);
        result = original_bind(sockfd, addr, addrlen);
        if (result == 0) break;  // Success!
    }
}
```

### Port Suggestion Algorithm

When a conflict occurs, the daemon suggests ports from the appropriate range:

1. **Service Type Detection**: Daemon infers service type (dev, api, test, etc.)
2. **Range Selection**: Suggests ports from the matching range (e.g., dev: 3000-3099)
3. **Availability Check**: Only suggests ports not currently allocated
4. **Sequential Allocation**: Suggests up to 5 ports in sequential order

### Performance Impact

**Minimal overhead:**
- If port is available: ~0.01ms overhead (single bind() call)
- If port is busy: ~50-100ms (daemon API call + retry)
- No overhead for ports outside interception scope (< 1024, non-TCP, IPv6)

### Security Considerations

1. **Local only**: Daemon only accepts connections from localhost
2. **Authentication**: All API calls require bearer token
3. **User scope**: LD_PRELOAD only affects processes you start
4. **Audit trail**: All reassignments logged with PID and timestamp

## FAQ

### Does this work with Docker containers?

No. LD_PRELOAD doesn't cross container boundaries. For containerized applications, use Styxy's CLI commands or Docker port mapping instead.

### Can I use this in production?

LD_PRELOAD mode is designed for development environments. For production, configure ports explicitly in your application configuration.

### What if the daemon is down?

The library gracefully handles daemon unavailability:
- If daemon is unreachable, the original `bind()` proceeds normally
- Application may fail with "Address already in use" (expected behavior without daemon)
- No crash or undefined behavior

### Will this break my application?

No. The library only intercepts TCP IPv4 bind() calls on user ports (>= 1024). All other operations pass through unchanged. Applications that check their bound port using `getsockname()` will see the correct reassigned port.

### How do I know what port my application is using?

1. Check the application's output (most servers log their port)
2. Check Claude's notification message
3. Check the audit log: `cat /tmp/styxy-reassignments.log`
4. Use Styxy CLI: `node bin/styxy list`

### Can I choose which ports to intercept?

Currently, all user ports (>= 1024) are intercepted. To disable interception for specific commands:

```bash
LD_PRELOAD="" your-command
```

### Does this work with https/SSL?

Yes. LD_PRELOAD intercepts the port binding, not the protocol. HTTPS/SSL works normally on the reassigned port.

### How do I report issues?

Check the audit log and daemon logs:

```bash
# Audit log
cat /tmp/styxy-reassignments.log

# Daemon status
node bin/styxy instances

# Test library manually
LD_PRELOAD=~/lib/styxy-intercept.so /tmp/test_bind 8000
```

Report issues with these logs to the development team.
